# JavaScript Basics - Counter
<h1>About the project</h1>
<p>I made this project for the Start2Impact Full Stack Development course.</br>
  The purpose of this project was to build a simple counter that starts from a base value of 0 and has two buttons to increase or decrease the value.
</p>
<h2>My Project</h2>

<p>
For my counter I decided to use a simple and nice cartoon style.
Both the buttons and the displayed value have been implemented using JavaScript.</br>
The entire application was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
